# Unix Network Programming (UNP) - C & Zig

This repository contains my learning implementation of examples from the classic book **"Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Networking API"** (3rd Edition) by W. Richard Stevens, Bill Fenner, and Andrew M. Rudoff.

I am porting the original C examples and also implementing them in **Zig** to learn modern systems programming alongside the classic concepts.

## Prerequisites

*   **C Compiler**: `gcc` or `clang` (supporting C11 standard).
*   **Zig Compiler**: `zig` (latest stable or master).
*   **Netcat**: `ncat` (from Nmap) or `nc` (OpenBSD netcat) for testing servers/clients.
*   **Make** (Optional): For potential future build automation.

## Directory Structure

*   `chapter-01/`: Introduction (Daytime Client/Server).
*   `chapter-xx/`: Future chapters...


## Resources

*   [Unp.pdf](unp.pdf) - The book reference (local copy).
